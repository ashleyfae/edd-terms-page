# EDD Terms Page
If you like to have a separate page for your sales terms, then you're probably like me and find it annoying to have to paste your terms in the EDD bos AND in the actual terms page.

This simple plugin allows you to select a page for your sales terms, and the contents of that page are automatically displayed on EDD's checkout page where you'd normally have to write the terms manually.
